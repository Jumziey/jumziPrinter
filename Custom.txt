	Make sure to have an easy ability to switch extruder hot end assembly
	for CNC milling eq
	Redesign rework plate for the magnetic attachement idea, use as base

x,y,z axis endstop
heatbed + alu plate ontop ONLY!Or only glass
	aluplate need to have space to expand
	but i still want to be able to hand screw, with knobs the

	Need to have multiple beds 1 for printing 1 for cnc
	maybe only a glass sheet after all
	Look for taps, not only is the assembly waaay easier then, but the heat bed can be adjusted with knobs
	Heat insulator for knobs? Must make sure they dont expand
	Springs for bed adjustment
